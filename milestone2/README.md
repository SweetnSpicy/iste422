# SDLC and Explanation

The SDLC Model that we chose for the project is Iterative. Iterative models have a better chance for success than the Waterfall model. It is very flexible, and allows us to work towards a goal every couple of days up to a week. 

We are doing a hybrid combination of the Iterative model with agile-scrum. We are taking some aspects of the agile-scrum model and modifying it, like we will do daily slack updates, instead of five minute standup meetings. We feel this is necessary because we are very distracted college students. The likelihood to continue working towards a goal over a large amount of time is less reliable than a reminder each day. 

We will also be taking the backlog idea. If there are issues with submission for a milestone in class we can easily incorporate the feedback especially if another stage of the project depends on it. Each milestone we will get together to design and plan for the cycle, figuring out the backlog for that cycle. If a milestone is larger we may break it up into multiple cycles. We will be managing the backlog using our GitHub repository. 

Our Milestone 1 was not completed, so we have been using the SDLC method discussed above to try and rectify the problems, most notibly communication and organization.
