# Deployment Strategy
We are using ant as our build system and are using it to create our package. Our package will consist of a jar and a README. We feel our program is small and simple enough that an .exe or installer would be overkill. We will make sure the README is as detailed and user friendly as possible to create a seamless process for the user.

The way we have our ant build setup is somewhat similar to what we have done in class. We are using it to compile and run our program for ourselves from ant. We are also using it to run our tests and make our jar.
