# Running our program

You should be able to run our program using the iste422.jar. Make sure your have Java installed before hand. Double clicking on the jar should run the program. If not then do a right click and "open with". Choose Java from the dropdown. When running the program for the output definition file path point to our "output-def" folder.

## Note to professor
The infinite loop should be solved. We are working on the other improvements but unfortunately they currently break everything. The output definition files were needed to function so they were included. Instructions on that will be included in the help system for milestone 4.
