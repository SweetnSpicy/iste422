# Test Plan

Our testing method is using JUnit and the workingExample.tar file provided in class. Slowly, but surely, assembling the code and mimicking the test steps. Upon writing of this document, two classes completely work, while the other two throws exceptions at parts.

The specific files we tested were CreateDDLMySQL.java, EdgeConvertFileParser.java, EdgeTable.java, and EdgeField.java. Each member of our team chose a file to test. You can tell who did what through the author string on each of the test files mentioned previously. We tested each method each of the files to make sure they did the expected behaviour, making sure to test our edge cases. Instructions on running each test is in the README.md file. Also we made sure to whe testing the sql output that the file was created and the tables were correclty created.
